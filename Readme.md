# Taito F2 System MiSTer Core

This is an FPGA implementation of the Taito F2 arcade system for the MiSTer platform. The Taito F2 system was used for arcade games from the late 1980s to early 1990s and featured advanced graphics capabilities including sprite scaling, multiple scroll layers, rotation, zoom and ADPCM sample playback.

The [F1](https://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=662) and [F2](https://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=661) System 16 pages both cover this hardware. It's unclear what the distinction is between them or where the naming comes from since the PCBs do not contain any markings with either name.
